Create a Password Generator with Python [10-characters long]

// short info:

After a very long break from programming, this is my first real project. I am glad that I finally refreshed my basic knowledge of Python and now I hope that I will soon expand my knowledge of this interesting programming language. It was a tough road to get here, but now I've finally managed to see progress. I hope to improve myself in the future when it comes to Python programming. So I'm trying to upload some of my projects here and I'm really looking forward to feedback and suggestions for improvement

// Now to the programm:

It's a simple password generator that will generates a 10-characters long password for you. The content of the password then consists at best of numbers, letters and special characters. Accordingly, the user can have a new password generated as often as he wants until he has had an optimal one created for him.
